## Development

If you would like to build this document from source, first you need to install TeX:

```Shell
# For ubuntu
$ sudo apt-get install texlive-full

# For Mac OX
$ brew cask install mactex
```

Once you have TeX installed, make sure that you can use `pdflatex` command in terminal. To build the document in PDF format:

```Shell
$ make
```

To automatically build the PDF while editing `.tex` file, you need to install watch-cli using `npm` first:

```Shell
$ npm install -g watch-cli
```

Then you start watching for changes:

```Shell
# change the filename to the file you want
$ watch -p "*.tex" -c "pdflatex -shell-escape -halt-on-error -interaction=nonstopmode cz4034-13-14-2.tex"
```
