\section{Question 1}

\noindent \textbf{Question 1a}

\noindent In at-least-once invocation semantics, if a client receives a reply message, the request has been executed for one or more than one times at the server. In at-most-once invocation semantics, if a client receives a reply message, the request has been executed for exactly one time. 

\noindent In at-least-once invocation semantics, when server receive a duplicate request, it will re-execute the request. In at-most-once invocation semantics, when server receive a duplicate request, it will send the previous reply again to the client.\\

\noindent \textbf{Question 1b}

\noindent Information given in the question:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Time spent in critical section by any process: $c$
  \item Message transmission delay: $d$
  \item Number of processes: $n$
\end{itemize}

\noindent For any algorithm, maximum throughput happens when when every process constantly wants to enter a critical section.\\

\noindent For central server algorithm, the throughput is:
$$\text{throughput}=\frac{1}{2d + c}$$

\noindent For ring-based algorithm, the throughput is:
$$\text{throughput}=\frac{1}{d + c}$$

\noindent For Ricart-and-Agrawala algorithm, the throughput is:
$$\text{throughput}=\frac{1}{d + c}$$

\noindent \textbf{Question 1c i}

\noindent When the freshness interval is 3 seconds, the client will only read the local cache within 3 seconds after the last validation time. If current time has passed 3 second freshness interval, the client will validation the file again with the server.\\

\noindent Take note that NFS server operations are stateless and idempotent.\\

\noindent Here is a list of consequences of client $A$ operations:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $r_1$: Since the cache is empty, client contacts server to get latest file. Client read the local copy, which is \emph{not} the most recent update by $B$.
  \item $r_2$: Client reads local copy of the file, which is \emph{not} the most recent update by $B$.
  \item $r_3$: Since the file is not fresh, client contacts server to validate the file. Since the file has been updated by $B$, server transfer the latest file to client. Client then read the most recent update of the file. 
  \item $r_4$: Client read the local copy, which is \emph{not} the most recent update by $B$.
  \item $r_5$: Since the file is not fresh, client contacts server to validate the file. Since the file has been updated by $B$, server transfer the latest file to client. Client then read the most recent update of the file. 
  \item $r_6$: Client read the local copy, which is \emph{not} the most recent update by $B$.
  \item $r_7$: Since the file is not fresh, client contacts server to validate the file. Since the file has been updated by $B$, server transfer the latest file to client. Client then read the most recent update of the file. 
  \item $r_8$: Client read the local copy, which is the most recent update by $B$.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent The time points when $A$ needs to contact the server are $r_1,r_3,r_5,r_7$.\\

\noindent The read operations of $A$ that return the most recent update by $B$ are $r_3,r_5,r_7,r_8$. \\

\noindent \textbf{Question 1c ii}

\noindent Callback mechanism is used to maintain cache con- sistency of client side. However, if there is an update at server side before a client close a session / file, the callback has no effect on the file at currect session. \\

\noindent As a result, only the read operation at $r_6,r_7,r_8$ read the most recent update by $B$. \\

\noindent The time points when $A$ needs to contact the server are $r_1,r_5,r_6,r_7,r_8$.\\
